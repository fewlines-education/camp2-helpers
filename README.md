# Camp2 Helpers

This package modifies the [expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect) and wrap it in a custom package in order to give an extra option to add a message when jest tests fails in Typescript.
It is based the package [jest-expect-message](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-expect-message) for custom use.
